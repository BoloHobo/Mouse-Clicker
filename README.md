# Mouse-Clicker
Just a small program to click your mouse for 100 seconds every 10 minutes
Open the bin/Debug/.exe for just the program

Originally made for Mob farming

*WARNING* there's no hotkey to stop the clicking once it's started, be careful what screen you leave your mouse on to keep from clicking on a whole bunch of stuff you don't want to click
