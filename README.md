# Mouse-Clicker
Just a small program to click your mouse for 100 seconds every 10 minutes
Open the bin/Debug/.exe for just the program
Originally made for Mob farming 
*WARNING* there's no hotkey to stop the clicking once it's started, be careful what screen you leave your mouse on to keep from clicking on whole bunch of stuff you don't want to click
